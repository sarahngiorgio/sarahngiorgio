## 🧠 MindfulDBT

**MindfulDBT** is a skills-based therapy companion app that helps people learn, practice, and apply evidence-based emotional regulation techniques.

The app is designed to help users:
- build emotional awareness
- practice DBT skills in real contexts
- reflect without overwhelm
- develop consistency through gentle structure

This project prioritizes:
- clarity over complexity
- emotional safety
- deterministic, explainable logic
- long-term maintainability

## 🛠️ Technical Focus

- TypeScript-first architecture
- Clean separation of client, server, and shared logic
- Deterministic decision systems (no black-box recommendations)
- Validation-driven workflows
- Testable, readable code

This is an actively evolving product, not a demo.

## 📐 Philosophy

I believe good software:
- respects the user’s cognitive load
- makes decisions transparent
- favors explicitness over magic
- is built to last, not just to ship
